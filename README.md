# ImagetoSelectedDirectory

## C++/CLI with .NET Framework
## Early Version -> v2.1 
### ImagetoSelectedDirectoy software was developed in inspiration to better file management.

ImagetoSelectedDirectory receives a path to the directory/folder, provided by you, and stores the path in the file named CommonsDirectory; the extented path to the directory 
is then displayed as an item in the combobox. In 'Enter Image,' you would enter the image address of an image found on the web: hover over image -> right click -> copy image address. 
Before executing/entering the address using the 'Enter' button, you must input the desired file name under 'File Name.' After entering, the status of the execution is displayed
on the bottom left-hand corner: 'Success' or 'Failed.' Given a 'Success' status, the image would be located in the provided directory.
